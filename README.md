# !! Please Read: This Project Is Changing / Moving !!

`Java-Text-Table-Formatter` is being deprecated and **replaced** by the (similarly named) `Java Text Tables` project:

* [Java Text Tables](https://github.com/iNamik/java_text_tables) ([https://github.com/iNamik/java_text_tables](https://github.com/iNamik/java_text_tables))

## But Why?

* I wanted to re-imagine the approach, with the goals of achieving greater extensibility, composability, and cohesion
* I wanted a new project url, as my project-naming-convention has changed over time
* I wanted to learn more about Maven

## What now?

This poject has been a success, gaining many watchers, stars and forks here on GitHub (end even before).

As such, I don't plan on removing this repo, but I am not planning on making any code changes either.

I am thrilled that I was able to provide a tool that people liked, and hope to build on that success in the new project.

Thank you all,
