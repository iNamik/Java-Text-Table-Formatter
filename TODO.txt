TODO
====

*	Not sure there needs to be an interface.

*	Considering seperating the row/table formatting methods into a different
	class/interface.  Maybe change the name to TextTable and then create a
	seperate TableFormatter class.

*	Also considering just moving the class as is into SimpleTextTable, which
	would leave room for a ComplexTextTable that might allow more control over
	the table formatting (i.e.  Specifying max column widths and/or word wrap)
